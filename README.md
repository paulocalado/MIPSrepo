# MIPS repo
just a bunch of mips code that I'm using to practice this f*cker, my goal is to put as much code as I can, from the basics to the hardcore sh1t.

I don't like mips, I'm just using because of my class so don't go to hard on me :p

those codes are based on this awesome MIPS Tutorial by Amell:
